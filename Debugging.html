    <p>
      JavaScript Debuggers:<br />
      Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a
      built-in JavaScript debugger. Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off,
      forcing errors to be reported to the user. With a debugger, you can also
      set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine
      variables while the code is executing. Normally, otherwise follow the
      steps at the bottom of this page, you activate debugging in your browser
      with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Setting Breakpoints: <br />
      In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At
      each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine
      JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of
      code (typically with a play button).

      b = 6;
      c = a + b;
      console.log(c);
