    <h2>Syntax Errors</h2>
    <p>
      Syntax errors, also called parsing errors, occur at compile time in
      traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JavaScript. For
      example, the following line causes a syntax error because it is missing a
      closing parenthesis.
    </p>
    <!-- <script type="text/javascript"> -->
    <!--
         window.print(;
         //Here syntax error occurs
      //-->
    <!-- </script> -->
    <h2>Runtime Errors</h2>
    <p>
      Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after
      compilation/interpretation). For example, the following line causes a
      runtime error because here the syntax is correct, but at runtime, it is
      trying to call a method that does not exist.
    </p>

    <!-- <script type = "text/javascript">
        <!--
           window.printme();
        //-->
    <!-- </script> -->

    <h2 onclick="myfunc()">Logical Errors</h2>
    <p>
      Logic errors can be the most difficult type of errors to track down. These
      errors are not the result of a syntax or runtime error. Instead, they
      occur when you make a mistake in the logic that drives your script and you
      do not get the result you expected. You cannot catch those errors, because
      it depends on your business requirement what type of logic you want to put
      in your program.
    </p>

    <script>
      let x = 10;
      //   if (x > 4) {
      //     throw "X is greater than 10";
      //   }
      try {
        ac56a1c1;
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error.message);
      } finally {
        console.log("Finally runs at the last of try catch");
      }
      // First error handling technique in js and most effective
      window.onerror = function (msg, url, linenum) {
        alert("An Error occured");
        alert(msg);
        alert(url);
        alert(linenum);
      };
    </script>
